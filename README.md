# The Web Wins

Everything we do is for the web, because the web is awesome. But we want more. 

Hi, we are **Candlestick**!

A group of people from the interwebs creating the next gen API to close the gab between hardware sensors, projectors, led, nfc, kinect and a web app to controll all of them at the same time. 


## What does that mean? 

Creating a unified way to control all the devices you want with one single master pc trough a REST API or a visuall UI
 

## Why are you doing this?

We want to win the $25k from [Google DevArt](https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/) and make this project in real.
