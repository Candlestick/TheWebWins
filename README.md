## What does that mean? 

Creating a unified way to control all the devices you want with one single master pc through a REST API and a visuall UI in the browser of your choice. 



## Devices? 

- Sensor (Motion, Temperature, Brightness, Loudness)
- Image Projector
- LED
- NFC
- Kinect
- Webcams
- Audio Systems
- Mobile Devices (Websockets + NFC)




## Do you have any sketches? 

- [TWW/Concept](https://redpen.io/dhm62r)
- [TWW/Projector](https://redpen.io/v3a571)





## Some examples, please?

- Change the projection based on detected persons in the room using kinect
- Play music, show the name of the artist, create visuals based on the music and use the led to flash like it's in a club or concert
- Picking one person in the room via webcam / kinect and playing a game with this person
- Use connected mobile devices from the people in the room to vote for changes in the UI (WebSockets + NFC)







## And how can you implement that?  

We are using the latest web shizzle to create an army before the Winter comes!

- Frontend: Angular or React
- Middleware: Node.js (Express, socket.io, Mongoose)
- Database: MongoDB
- Connected Workers (local private WiFi): Node.js
- Build: Grunt

## Why are you doing this?
